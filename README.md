## Danboorus

This is a multitenant version of Danbooru. It allows users to setup
their own Danbooru instance online without having to manually install 
the software on a server. It is forked from the original Danbooru 
project but has a reduced feature set to make it easier to administer
and maintain.

The following features are not supported:

* Artists
* Tag categories
* Janitors
* Favorite groups
* Tag aliases
* Tag implications
* Super voters
* User similarity reports
* Admin dashboard
* Counts API
* API keys
* Missed search reports
* Popular search reports
* IQDB
* CCS
* Saved searches
* Post appeals
* Legacy API
* Post replacements
* Bulk update requests
* Dmail filters
* Popular posts
* Tag corrections
* Post bans
* Post flags

Some other important feature differences:

* There is no mandatory moderation process. All uploads are approved by 
default.
* There are only four user levels now: basic, gold, platinum, and admin.
* Users can additionaly have Booru-specific permissions: moderator and founder.

Because Danboorus uses a payment processor, some content is banned: children, lolita, pre-teen, snuff, scat, mutilation, bestiality, and rape. There are no exceptions. Any banned content will be deleted and expunged.

Users are global. That means you have one identity across different Boorus (much like users on Reddit across different subreddits).

Gold accounts are $10/year. Platinum accounts are $20/year. The major difference is how many tags you can search at once.

Building a new Booru is free. However, free Boorus are initially limited to 10,000 posts. If you want to upload more, you (or anyone else) can pay $10 to increase the limit another 10,000. There are ways to gain free credits, however.

All income generated from Danboorus will go into a common Danbooru fund and will only be used for servers, services, and marketing.
